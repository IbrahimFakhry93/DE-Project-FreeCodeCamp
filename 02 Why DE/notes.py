# & Why Data Engineering?

# * Data engineering is becoming increasingly important
# * due to high failure rates in big data projects.
# * Studies show 85–87% of big data projects fail,
# * mainly because of unreliable infrastructures and poor data quality.

#! Reasons for failure:
# * Unreliable data infrastructure
# * Incorrect data modeling
# * Redundant work for data scientists
# * High turnover among data scientists

# ? Role of data engineers:
# * Build reliable infrastructure
# * Ensure proper data modeling
# * Reduce redundant work
# * Process data and extract value efficiently

# ? Compensation:
# * In the US, median salary ranges from $90k to $150k per year
# * Salary depends on location and market conditions

# ? Business potential and impact:
# * Crucial role in enabling data-driven decisions
# * Especially important in AI and ML applications
# * With the rise of ChatGPT and AI tools, data engineers determine how data is managed and used

# ^ Responsibilities of data engineers:
# * Ensure efficient management and processing of data downstream
# * Guarantee data quality, security, and availability
# * Provide properly formatted data to teams (data scientists, analysts, etc.)
# * Maintain continuous data flow without interruptions

# ? Outcomes:
# * Better insights and outcomes for the company
# * Drives innovation and competitiveness
# * Helps both the company and teams thrive
